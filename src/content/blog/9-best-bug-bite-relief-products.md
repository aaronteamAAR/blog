Bug bites can be a nuisance, especially in warmer weather. They cause itching, swelling, and redness, with children and adolescents often experiencing stronger reactions. It's crucial to identify the type of bug that bit you promptly to prevent potential complications like Lyme disease, which can result from tick bites.

[Mosquito bites](https://www.health.com/mosquito-bites-7508546), the most common allergic reaction, can result in red, swollen, itchy, painful skin lesions lasting up to 10 days. Experts recommend stocking up on bug bite relief products if you're sensitive or planning outdoor activities. These products provide instant relief from pain and itchiness caused by bug bites.

Look for items with numbing agents,**hydrocortisone for inflammation**, **antihistamines for redness and swelling reduction**, and skin protectants. We consulted allergists and dermatologists for advice on effective bug bite relief. If concerned about disease or infection, seek medical attention.

## Types of Bug Bite Relief Products

Bug bite relief products come in various forms to suit different needs. The popular options include sprays, creams, ointments, sticks, patches, and suction devices.

- **Sprays**, like [Benadryl's Extra Strength Itch Cooling Spray](https://wayward.com/s/Y1MEXNqe), offer a mess-free application and a cooling sensation for instant relief.

- **Creams, ointments, and balms**, such as [Gold Bond Medicated Maximum Strength Pain & Itch Cream and Badger's Itch Relief Stick](https://wayward.com/s/cDdZnDQY), provide effective relief but may leave your hands feeling greasy or sticky and could stain clothes.

- **Patches**, like [Magic Patch Itch Relief Patches](https://wayward.com/s/V8f3pTAT), offer a convenient and travel-friendly option for bug bite relief without the mess.

- **Suction devices** are designed to remove saliva or venom from bites, but according to Kelly Maples, MD, there's no evidence supporting their effectiveness in improving bug bite reactions.



## Common Bug Bite Relief Ingredients
Bug bite relief products contain various active ingredients aimed at easing itching and discomfort. These include:

- Camphor and menthol: Provide a cooling sensation on the skin.

- Lidocaine and pramoxine: Numb the area to reduce itch and pain.

- Hydrocortisone: Reduces inflammation, lessening redness, swelling, and itch.

- Diphenhydramine (Benadryl): Diminishes redness, swelling, and itch as an antihistamine.

- Zinc oxide (Calamine lotion): Dries oozing or weeping lesions and has mild antiseptic properties.

- Essential oils (e.g., peppermint, lavender): Offer natural itch relief but can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, [according to a 2021 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352647520301611).


Dr. Rogge advises against regularly using over-the-counter antibiotics like neomycin, bacitracin, and polymyxin B for bug bites unless infection is suspected. Regular use can sensitize and possibly trigger a topical allergy, causing more redness, swelling, itching, and even blisters. Check the label for these ingredients if you want to avoid them



#### Our best overall picks

Benadryl's Extra Strength Anti-Itch Cooling Spray is a powerful solution for bug bites. Its key ingredient, diphenhydramine, blocks histamine, providing relief. Dermatologist Megan Rogge, MD, explains that diphenhydramine reduces redness, swelling, and itchiness.

The spray also contains zinc oxide, drying out bites. Just apply and let it dry for lasting relief. Its compact 2-ounce size makes it perfect for travel, offering itch relief wherever you go.


Product Details:

- Type: Lotion
- Size: 6 oz.

- Key Ingredients: Calamine 8%, zinc oxide 8%

You might remember this classic pink itch-relief lotion from your childhood. Calamine's active ingredients are zinc and iron oxide. Calamine is an astringent with mild antiseptic properties, and it works by drying up lesions, Dr. Rogge says.

Calamine lotion works well on insect bites, chicken pox, shingles, heat rash, and other uncomfortable conditions, and it's great at reducing not only itching but swelling and irritation too. To apply, shake the bottle well, pour some of the calamine onto a cotton ball, and then dab it on the bug bite and let it dry. You can apply it multiple times a day safely, and while the bottle is large enough to use on the entire body, a little goes a long way. The liquid is very thin and runny, so application can be a little messy. And it leaves a pale pink powdery residue on your skin that may look a little funny.


Product Details:

- Type: Lotion
- Size: 6 oz.
- Best For: Mosquito bites, bee stings, and other insect-related skin reactions
- Key Ingredients: Calamine 8%, zinc oxide 8%

This travel-friendly bug bite relief stick is small enough to stash in your purse, backpack, or pocket, so it might just become your companion through hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities. The diphenhydramine-based formula relieves itching, swelling, pain, and irritation from all kinds of insect bites almost instantly. Simply hold the stick straight down and apply it on bug bites. 

We love that Benadryl's itch relief stick makes for a no-mess application, which deems it perfect for using on kids' bug bites so long as the child isn't under 2 years old (if they are, ask a pediatrician before using this product). Unlike creams or lotions, you don't have to rub this medication on your skin—just apply and go, no sticky residue or greasy hands to worry about. 

Product Details:

- Size: 0.47 oz.

This **chemical-free**, FDA-cleared device works by **emitting concentrated heat up to 124 degrees Fahrenheit** to numb your bug bites, reduce swelling, and provide instant relief. It's effective on bites from mosquitoes, wasps, bees, ants, sea lice, chiggers and more. 

Simply place the pen's ceramic tip on your bug bite and select either 3 or 5 seconds (we suggest starting with 3 seconds), and then the pen will emit heat. If you're looking for a heat-based device that's free of chemicals or other active ingredients, this may be worth trying.

You can safely use Bite Away Insect Sting & Itch Relief Stick up to 5 times per hour—just make sure to wait 2 minutes in between uses. While it's the most expensive product on this list, coming in at around $30, you only have to purchase it once because there's nothing in it that will run out, unlike a cream, spray, or balm. You'll get around 300 uses before you'll have to replace the batteries. 

Product Details:

- Type: Heating device
- Size: 6.5"L x 1"W x 1.13"H
- Best For: itchiness and swelling from bug bites
- Key Ingredients: None



## Your Questions, Answered
### What’s the best product to stop bug bites from itching? 
The best product to relieve discomfort from itching is one you'll actually use. We love the Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Cooling Spray because it provides instant relief that lasts hours, it's easy to use, and it's travel-friendly. If you want a chemical-free option, we like Badger's Itch Relief Stick, which is made with menthol that cools and soothes itchy skin. 

### How fast do bug bite relief products work? 
Most bug bite relief products work within seconds. Products that rely on essential oils rather than chemicals, like Magic Patch Itch Relief Patches might take a little longer to work—up to one minute. 

## When should you apply something to a bug bite?  

It's normal to get a mild reaction to mosquito bites—you'll usually find that the redness develops about 20 minutes after the bite followed by an itchy firm bump that forms over the next day or two and can last for 7-10 days, Dr. Maples says. 

You should apply a product to the bug bite as soon as you feel discomfort. Bug bite relief products work almost instantly, so the faster you apply it to the affected area, the quicker you'll find relief. Always make sure to apply it to clean skin.
